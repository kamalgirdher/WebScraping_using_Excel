### SubProcedures & Functions

**What is Sub-procedure?**
A sub-procedure is set of statements that perform action(s) but do not return a value. A function on the other hand does the same thing, but returns a value.

A sub-procedure is always enclosed between **Sub** and **End Sub**.

```
Sub test
' set of statements
End Sub
```

If you are just starting with VBA, I would suggest to watch & follow my youtube channel to learn VBA basics before moving ahead with this course.
