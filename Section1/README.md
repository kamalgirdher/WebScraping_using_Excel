# Introduction

### What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is a practice of collecting data from a website for use elsewhere. We typically automate the process by writing a script or using a software. In this course, we are going to learn about scraping web applications using Excel VBA and Selenium. 

In our (previous course)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0tW5hzUTRw&list=PL1R_HJw0CDYKYzExtZfhKZRddhwv5i-rg], we have already learnt how to do this on Internet Explorer using VBA, Microsoft HTML library and Internet Controls. Now in this series, we would learn the same on Chrome, Firefox and other browsers using some third party libraries based on Selenium.

** SCRAPING IS NOT ILLEGAL**, unless you are scraping your own website or blog. We therefore do not promote Data Scraping in any way. Before you continue with this course, you accept that you won't misuse the content for any unauthorized or illegal activity.
